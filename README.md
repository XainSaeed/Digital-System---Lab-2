# Digital-System---Lab-2
 In Lab 2, we designed and simulated a digital circuit using Verilog/SystemVerilog. Tasks included constructing a truth table, correcting errors in provided Verilog code, and developing a testbench for verification. Simulation using QuestaSim validated the correctness of the design.
